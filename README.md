# FCFS-scheduling-algorithm
simulating FCFS algorithm in java 


This small program simulating the FCFS scheduling algorithm .
Simulating means waiting all process to finish as real life .
That means will not give you the output immediately .

The process created in .txt file as following :
Pid AT Bt1 IO1 BT2 IO2 .... and so on

The program will give :
Pid At TotalBurstTime ComplitionTime TurnAroundTime WaitingTime 
then gives the avarage of waiting time .

The test cases design to success if the avg time is in 
correct range because there is no one exact solution in multithreading
DO NOT run more than test case in same time .
